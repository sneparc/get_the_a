				<p>The "Get the A" Tutor help students "Get the A" in a variety of subjects, including Latin and SAT II Latin. I have taken many Latin courses from Introductory to Advanced Levels. I have much experience tutoring students in high school. Coming from a foreign language background as I have taken Italian, Hebrew, Ancient Greek, and Latin, I have much knowledge of how languages work. This helps with my Latin, and through this experience, it makes me an effective tutor. My teaching style is very versatile. I use a variety of different teaching methods that incorporates different learning styles. I use auditory, visual, and kinesthetic teaching methods so that learning becomes a fun and active activity. I am a very patient person, and this shows in my teaching and tutoring. I acknowledge the fact that learning is a slow process, so I think it is important for many opportunities for repetition. I also acknowledge the fact that many students do not understand concepts very quickly, so I am happy to go over them as much as they need.

					I also have experience in programming languages, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JQUERY. I am happy to help your son or daughter in these languages too.
